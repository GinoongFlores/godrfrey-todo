## 6. Risk Assessment

*   **RISK-001: Incorrect RBAC Implementation:**
    *   **Description:** The core complexity lies in correctly implementing and enforcing RBAC across all features. Errors could lead to security vulnerabilities (unauthorized access to data/actions).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Mitigation:** Thorough design review of RBAC logic, extensive unit and integration testing specifically for permissions, code reviews focused on security-sensitive areas, potential third-party security testing/audits.

*   **RISK-002: Performance Bottlenecks:**
    *   **Description:** As the number of users and tasks grows, querying and filtering tasks while enforcing RBAC could lead to slow performance.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Mitigation:** Database indexing strategy review, query optimization, caching mechanisms, load testing early and often, scalable architecture design.

*   **RISK-003: Scope Creep:**
    *   **Description:** The desire to add more task management features or complex RBAC scenarios (e.g., group-based permissions, row-level security beyond user/task relationship) could expand the project scope beyond the initial constraints.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Strong change management process, clear definition of MVP, regular stakeholder communication to manage expectations.

*   **RISK-004: Technical Complexity:**
    *   **Description:** Implementing a robust, secure, and scalable RBAC system can be technically challenging, requiring specialized knowledge.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Assign experienced developers to critical RBAC components, consider using well-established RBAC libraries or frameworks if appropriate, allocate sufficient time for design and implementation.

*   **RISK-005: User Adoption Issues:**
    *   **Description:** If the interface is not intuitive or the concept of RBAC is confusing for administrators setting up roles/permissions, user adoption may be low.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on user-centric UI design, conduct usability testing with target users, provide clear documentation and training for administrators, simplify RBAC configuration options where possible in v1.0.
