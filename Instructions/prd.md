# Product Requirements Document: Collaborative TODO List with RBAC

## 1. Document Header

*   **Document Title:** Collaborative TODO List with RBAC PRD
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** July 5, 2025
*   **Author:** [Your Name/Team Name]

## 2. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for building a collaborative TODO list application enhanced with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The application aims to provide teams with a structured and secure way to manage tasks, assign responsibilities, and track progress, ensuring that users only have access and permissions relevant to their roles. This will improve team organization, accountability, and productivity while maintaining data integrity and security through granular access controls. The initial version will focus on core task management, user/role administration, and the fundamental application of RBAC permissions.

## 3. Product Vision

The vision for this application is to become the go-to task management solution for small to medium-sized teams who require more than just a simple shared list. We envision a platform that empowers team leaders to delegate effectively and control information flow, while providing team members with clear visibility into their responsibilities.

*   **Purpose:** To provide a secure, organized, and collaborative task management system for teams by implementing robust Role-Based Access Control.
*   **Target Users:** Small to medium-sized teams, project managers, team leaders, and team members across various industries.
*   **Business Goals:**
    *   Achieve initial user adoption within target teams.
    *   Establish a foundation for future features like advanced reporting, integrations, and tiered access plans (though monetization is not in scope for v1).
    *   Improve team productivity and reduce overhead associated with managing task access manually.
    *   Build a reputation for a reliable and secure collaborative tool.

## 4. User Personas

*   **Persona Name:** The Team Lead (Admin/Manager)
    *   **Goals:** Organize team projects, delegate tasks effectively, monitor team progress, ensure data security, manage user access and permissions, maintain overall control.
    *   **Pain Points:** Difficulty tracking who is doing what, lack of control over sensitive information, manual effort in managing team member access to tasks/projects, ensuring everyone has the *right* level of access without oversharing.
    *   **Needs:** Ability to create/manage users and roles, define granular permissions, create/manage projects/tasks, assign tasks, view all team activities, easily see task status across projects.

*   **Persona Name:** The Team Member (Contributor)
    *   **Goals:** Clearly understand assigned tasks, update task status, add personal tasks, collaborate on shared tasks (if permitted), focus on their own work.
    *   **Pain Points:** Unclear assignments, difficulty finding relevant tasks, not knowing the status of tasks others are working on (if dependencies exist), accidentally modifying tasks they shouldn't, being overwhelmed by too much information.
    *   **Needs:** Easy access to their assigned tasks, ability to update task status/details (within permissions), ability to create new tasks (within permissions), view shared project tasks (within permissions), clear UI showing their responsibilities.

*   **Persona Name:** The Viewer (Optional/Guest Role)
    *   **Goals:** See project progress, view specific task details, stay informed without needing to modify anything.
    *   **Pain Points:** Not having access to necessary information, being accidentally able to modify data, complex interfaces designed for contributors.
    *   **Needs:** Read-only access to specific projects or tasks, simple view interface, no distracting edit/management options.

## 5. Feature Specifications

### 5.1 Authentication

*   **Description:** Users can securely sign up and log in to the application.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a new user, I want to sign up with my email and password so I can create an account.
    *   As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials so I can access the application.
    *   As a user, I want to be automatically logged out after a period of inactivity for security.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given I am on the signup page, When I enter valid email and password and click "Sign Up", Then my account is created, and I am redirected to the dashboard.
    *   Given I am on the login page, When I enter valid email and password and click "Login", Then I am authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.
    *   Given I am on the login page, When I enter invalid credentials and click "Login", Then I receive an "Invalid credentials" error message.
    *   Given I am logged in, When I am inactive for [configurable time, e.g., 30 mins], Then I am automatically logged out and prompted to log in again.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Attempting to sign up with an email already in use.
    *   Password strength requirements not met during signup.
    *   Account is disabled or deleted.

### 5.2 User Management (Admin Feature)

*   **Description:** Administrators can invite, view, edit, and remove users, and assign roles to them.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As an Admin, I want to invite a new user via email so they can join the team.
    *   As an Admin, I want to view a list of all registered users.
    *   As an Admin, I want to edit a user's details (e.g., name) and assign/change their role.
    *   As an Admin, I want to remove a user from the team.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I go to the User Management section and click "Invite User", and enter a valid email and assign a role, Then an invitation is sent (or account is created directly depending on flow) and the user appears in the user list with the assigned role.
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I navigate to the User Management section, Then I see a list of all users, their emails, and their current roles.
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I select a user from the list and edit their details or change their role, Then the user's information and role are updated successfully.
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I select a user and confirm removal, Then the user is removed from the team and can no longer log in.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Inviting a user with an email already in the system.
    *   Attempting to remove the last Admin user.
    *   Removing a user who has assigned tasks (Tasks should ideally remain or be reassigned).
    *   Non-Admin user attempting to access User Management.

### 5.3 Role & Permission Management (Admin Feature)

*   **Description:** Administrators can define custom roles and assign specific permissions to each role.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As an Admin, I want to view a list of all available roles and their associated permissions.
    *   As an Admin, I want to create a new custom role and define its permissions.
    *   As an Admin, I want to edit an existing role's name or permissions.
    *   As an Admin, I want to delete a custom role.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I navigate to the Role Management section, Then I see a list of system default roles (e.g., Admin, Member) and any custom roles, along with a summary of their permissions.
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I click "Create Role", provide a name, and select permissions from a predefined list (e.g., `task:create`, `task:view:own`, `task:view:all`, `task:edit:own`, `task:edit:assigned`, `task:edit:all`, `task:delete:own`, `task:delete:all`, `user:manage`, `role:manage`, `project:create`, `project:view`, `project:edit`, `project:delete`), Then a new role is created with the specified permissions.
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I select a role and modify its name or check/uncheck permissions, Then the role's definition is updated, and these changes apply to all users with that role.
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I select a custom role and confirm deletion, Then the role is removed. (Requires handling users assigned to this role - see edge cases).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Attempting to delete a system default role (e.g., Admin, Member) - should be prevented.
    *   Attempting to delete a role that is currently assigned to one or more users (System should require reassignment of users before deletion is allowed).
    *   Creating a role with no permissions.
    *   Defining complex or conflicting permissions (System should enforce clarity).
    *   Non-Admin user attempting to access Role Management.

### 5.4 Project Management

*   **Description:** Users with appropriate permissions can create, view, edit, and delete projects to organize tasks.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user with `project:create` permission, I want to create a new project.
    *   As a user with `project:view` permission, I want to view a list of projects I have access to.
    *   As a user with `project:edit` permission, I want to edit a project's name or description.
    *   As a user with `project:delete` permission, I want to delete a project.
    *   As a user, I want to see which tasks belong to which project.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given I have `project:create` permission, When I click "Create Project" and enter a name and description, Then a new project is created and appears in the project list.
    *   Given I have `project:view` permission, When I navigate to the Projects section, Then I see a list of projects I have access to view.
    *   Given I have `project:edit` permission for a specific project, When I edit its details, Then the changes are saved.
    *   Given I have `project:delete` permission for a specific project, When I confirm deletion, Then the project is removed. (Requires handling tasks within the project).
    *   Given a project has associated tasks, When viewing the project or tasks, Then the link between them is clear.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User without `project:create` permission attempts to create a project.
    *   User without `project:view` permission attempts to view projects.
    *   User without `project:edit` permission attempts to edit a project.
    *   User without `project:delete` permission attempts to delete a project.
    *   Deleting a project that contains tasks (System should prompt user on what to do with tasks: archive, delete, or reassign). For v1, perhaps prevent deletion until empty or offer simple delete-all-tasks option.
    *   Project name is empty.

### 5.5 Task Management (CRUD & Assignment)

*   **Description:** Users with appropriate permissions can create, view, edit, mark complete, delete tasks, and assign them to users within projects they have access to. RBAC is applied to all actions.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user with `task:create` permission within a project I can access, I want to create a new task within that project.
    *   As a user with `task:view:own`, `task:view:assigned`, or `task:view:all` permission, I want to view tasks I have access to.
    *   As a user with `task:edit:own`, `task:edit:assigned`, or `task:edit:all` permission for a task, I want to edit its details (title, description, due date).
    *   As a user with `task:edit:assigned` or `task:edit:all` permission for a task, I want to assign/reassign it to another user.
    *   As a user with `task:edit:own`, `task:edit:assigned`, or `task:edit:all` permission for a task, I want to mark a task as complete.
    *   As a user with `task:delete:own` or `task:delete:all` permission for a task, I want to delete a task.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given I have `task:create` permission in Project A, When I create a task in Project A with title, description, and optional due date/assignee, Then the task is created and appears in Project A's task list.
    *   Given I am on the dashboard/task list, When I have `task:view:own`, `task:view:assigned`, or `task:view:all` permissions, Then I see a list of tasks I am permitted to view, potentially filtered based on the permission type (e.g., only my own tasks, only assigned tasks, or all tasks).
    *   Given I have `task:edit:all` permission for Task X, When I update its title or description, Then the changes are saved.
    *   Given I have `task:edit:assigned` permission for Task Y assigned to User A, When I reassign it to User B, Then User B becomes the assignee.
    *   Given I have `task:edit:own` permission for Task Z that I created, When I mark it as complete, Then its status changes to "Complete".
    *   Given I have `task:delete:all` permission for Task W, When I confirm deletion, Then the task is removed.
    *   Given I attempt an action (create, view, edit, delete, assign, complete) on a task without the required permission, Then the action is blocked, and an appropriate error message is displayed (e.g., "You do not have permission to perform this action").
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Creating a task with an empty title.
    *   Setting an invalid due date format or a date in the past (unless allowed).
    *   Assigning a task to a user who doesn't exist or who has been removed.
    *   Attempting to edit a task concurrently with another user (Backend needs a strategy, e.g., last-write-wins or optimistic/pessimistic locking).
    *   Deleting a project that contains tasks (as per Project Management edge cases).
    *   User attempting to edit/delete a task after their permission has been revoked.

### 5.6 Task Filtering & Sorting

*   **Description:** Users can filter and sort tasks based on attributes like assignee, due date, status, and project. RBAC applies to the tasks shown.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to filter tasks by assignee so I can see who is working on what (within my view permissions).
    *   As a user, I want to filter tasks by due date (e.g., upcoming, overdue) so I can prioritize my work.
    *   As a user, I want to filter tasks by status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Complete).
    *   As a user, I want to filter tasks by project.
    *   As a user, I want to sort tasks by due date, creation date, or priority (if priority is added).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given I am viewing tasks and have `task:view:all` permission, When I select a user from the assignee filter dropdown, Then the list only shows tasks assigned to that user that I am permitted to see.
    *   Given I am viewing tasks, When I select "Overdue" from the due date filter, Then the list only shows tasks with a due date in the past that I am permitted to see.
    *   Given I am viewing tasks, When I click the "Sort by Due Date" column header, Then the tasks are displayed in order of due date (ascending/descending).
    *   Given I filter/sort, Then the filters and sort order persist until cleared or changed.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Filtering by an assignee who has no tasks I can see.
    *   Filtering by a project I don't have view permission for (should show no tasks).
    *   Applying conflicting filters (e.g., Status: Complete AND Due Date: Overdue).

### 5.7 Activity Log (Future Enhancement)

*   **Description:** A chronological record of significant actions performed on tasks and projects (e.g., task created, status changed, assigned, deleted; project created/deleted; user role changed). Access controlled by permission.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user with `activity:view` permission, I want to see a log of recent activities related to tasks and projects I have access to.
    *   As an Admin, I want to see a log of user and role management activities.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given I have `activity:view` permission, When I view the Activity Log, Then I see a list of actions (who, what, when) that occurred on tasks/projects I can view.
    *   Given I am an Admin, When I view the Activity Log, Then I see actions related to user creation/deletion and role changes.
    *   Given a task's status is changed, Then an entry appears in the Activity Log noting the change, the user who made it, and the timestamp.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User without `activity:view` permission attempts to access the log.
    *   Filtering/sorting the log (future).
    *   Log size becomes very large (pagination needed).

## 6. Technical Requirements

*   **Architecture:** Client-Server architecture.
    *   **Frontend:** Single Page Application (SPA) using a modern framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular). Needs to consume the backend API. UI components should adapt based on the user's permissions fetched from the backend upon login/role change.
    *   **Backend:** RESTful API using a framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails, Java/Spring, Go). All business logic, including permission checks, MUST reside in the backend.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   Authentication: `POST /api/auth/signup`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`
    *   Users: `GET /api/users`, `POST /api/users`, `GET /api/users/:id`, `PUT /api/users/:id`, `DELETE /api/users/:id` (Requires `user:manage` permission)
    *   Roles: `GET /api/roles`, `POST /api/roles`, `GET /api/roles/:id`, `PUT /api/roles/:id`, `DELETE /api/roles/:id` (Requires `role:manage` permission)
    *   Permissions: `GET /api/permissions` (List of available permissions)
    *   Projects: `GET /api/projects`, `POST /api/projects`, `GET /api/projects/:id`, `PUT /api/projects/:id`, `DELETE /api/projects/:id` (Permission checks based on action/project)
    *   Tasks: `GET /api/tasks` (with filters/sorting query params), `POST /api/tasks`, `GET /api/tasks/:id`, `PUT /api/tasks/:id`, `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` (Permission checks based on action/task/assignee/project)
    *   Activity Log: `GET /api/activity` (Requires `activity:view` permission)
*   **Data Storage:** Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    *   **Schema:**
        *   `users` table: id, email (unique), password_hash, name, created_at, updated_at.
        *   `roles` table: id, name (unique), description.
        *   `permissions` table: id, name (unique), description.
        *   `role_permissions` table: role_id (FK to roles), permission_id (FK to permissions) - Many-to-Many join table.
        *   `user_roles` table: user_id (FK to users), role_id (FK to roles) - Many-to-Many join table (a user could potentially have multiple roles, though v1 might simplify to one role per user).
        *   `projects` table: id, name, description, created_by (FK to users), created_at, updated_at.
        *   `tasks` table: id, project_id (FK to projects), title, description, due_date (nullable), assigned_to (FK to users, nullable), status (enum: 'todo', 'in_progress', 'complete'), created_by (FK to users), created_at, updated_at.
        *   `activity_log` table: id, user_id (FK to users), action (e.g., 'task_created', 'user_role_changed'), entity_type (e.g., 'task', 'project', 'user'), entity_id (ID of the affected entity), details (JSONB for context, e.g., old_value, new_value), created_at.
*   **Security:**
    *   Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
    *   Authentication via tokens (e.g., JWT) or sessions.
    *   **Strict Backend Authorization:** Every API endpoint that performs a sensitive action *must* check if the authenticated user's roles have the required permissions for that specific action and resource (e.g., does the user have `task:delete:all` *or* (`task:delete:own` AND user is creator)?).
    *   Input validation on all API endpoints.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
*   **Scalability:** Consider database indexing, connection pooling. Design with clear separation of concerns to allow for future scaling.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to building the application, prioritizing core functionality and the fundamental RBAC implementation.

**Phase 1: Core Task & Project Management (Minimum Viable Product)**

*   **Focus:** Basic multi-user task/project creation, viewing, editing, and deletion *without* granular RBAC enforced yet (perhaps simple creator/admin logic initially, or no edit/delete restrictions). Authentication is key.
*   **Features:**
    *   User Authentication (Signup, Login, Logout)
    *   Basic User Model (no roles yet)
    *   Project CRUD (Create, View List, View Detail, Edit, Delete - simple permission model like creator=editor/deleter)
    *   Task CRUD within Projects (Create, View List, View Detail, Edit, Mark Complete, Delete - simple permission model like creator=editor/deleter)
    *   Basic dashboard showing tasks (e.g., all tasks user created/is assigned to).
*   **Deliverables:** A functional web application where logged-in users can manage projects and tasks they create.

**Phase 2: RBAC Foundation**

*   **Focus:** Implement the core RBAC model and integrate it into the backend API for authorization checks. Frontend UI starts respecting permissions.
*   **Features:**
    *   Role Model
    *   Permission Model (Define the specific permissions: `task:create`, `task:view:own`, etc.)
    *   `role_permissions` and `user_roles` relationships
    *   Admin UI for User Management (Create, View, Edit, Delete, **Assign Role**)
    *   Admin UI for Role & Permission Management (Create, View, Edit, Delete custom roles, **Assign Permissions to Roles**)
    *   **Backend Permission Checks:** Update all API endpoints (`/api/projects`, `/api/tasks`, `/api/users`, `/api/roles`) to check the user's permissions before executing the action. This is the most critical part of this phase.
    *   **Frontend UI Adaptation:** Frontend fetches user's permissions on login and hides/disables UI elements (buttons, links, forms) for actions the user is not permitted to perform. (Backend check is the *source of truth*, but UI adaptation provides a better UX).
*   **Deliverables:** An application where different users have different roles, and these roles restrict what they can see and do via backend checks and frontend UI updates.

**Phase 3: Collaborative Features & Refinements**

*   **Focus:** Add key collaboration features and improve usability based on the RBAC structure.
*   **Features:**
    *   Task Assignment: Users with appropriate permissions can assign tasks to other users.
    *   Task Filtering & Sorting: Implement advanced filtering (by assignee, status, due date, project) and sorting based on view permissions.
    *   Basic Activity Log (View only, controlled by permission).
    *   Refine UI/UX based on testing.
    *   Improve error handling and user feedback (especially for permission errors).
*   **Deliverables:** A more robust collaborative tool where teams can assign and filter tasks effectively under controlled access.

**Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Backlog)**

*   Comments on tasks
*   Notifications (in-app, email)
*   Recurring tasks
*   Task dependencies
*   More detailed reporting (e.g., task completion rates per user/project)
*   Guest/External user roles with very limited access
*   Team/Group management (layers on top of users/roles)

This roadmap provides a structured path, ensuring the core value proposition (TODO list with RBAC) is delivered before adding layers of complexity. RBAC implementation in Phase 2 is critical and requires careful planning and development across all API endpoints.
