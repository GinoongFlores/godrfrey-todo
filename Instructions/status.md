**Key Features:**
*   User Authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout)
*   Task Management (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Mark Complete)
*   Task List/Project Management
*   Role Definition (e.g., Admin, Manager, Editor, Viewer)
*   User-to-Role Assignment
*   Permission System (Defining actions per role)
*   RBAC Enforcement on all relevant actions and UI elements
*   User Profile Management
*   Sharing/Collaboration Features (e.g., sharing lists with users/roles)

**Timeline:**
*   **Start Date:** [Project Start Date]
*   **Planned End Date:** [Target Completion Date]
*   **Current Phase:** [e.g., Planning, Development, Testing, Deployment]
